## Setup (One Time)

	pnpm build (this runs for a few minutes but makes the app much faster)                                                                                 
                                                                                                   
## Launch the App

## Everything Ebooks - it's right there in the name.                                                                     

## A principled stance that aligns perfectly with this app's identity. 
                                                                                                
### ★ Insight                  
- **DOCX** is one bridge 
    - a necessary format for interop with existing publishing tools 
	- (Vellum, Atticus, even agents/editors who want Word files)                                                              
- **PDF** is for print 
    - and this app is not in the business of encouraging print                          
- **Ebooks** are the destination 
	- **EPUB** is the native format, and that's where the story lives       

#### The environmental argument holds up too. 
- E-readers and phones:                                    
    - Already exist in people's pockets
    - One device to read thousands of books, and with tiny fingers write them too
    - No shipping, no pulp, no ink, no warehouse, no fossil fuels
                 
#### The pipeline is covered:
- Write → PlateJS editor in **/authors**
- Export → EPUB (native) or DOCX (for Vellum/Atticus)
- Read → **/library** with a Foliate-based reader

> That's a complete ebook-first workflow.
>
> No forests harmed. 🌲 🌴 🪾 🌳 🏝️ 🌱
