1. HOMEPAGE HERO

Title + tagline:

Proselenos
A DRM-free reading and writing space where you keep control of your books.

Subpoints:

E-Reader Mode - A personal EPUB library that lives on your device, with an optional Book Repo for backup and restore.

Authors Mode - An AI-assisted writing studio with manuscript tools and a path to publish into the Proselenos Bookstore.


2. FOR READERS SECTION

For readers

Proselenos is for people who want a digital library without the usual lock-in.

You own your library. Your books are stored locally in the app so you can read offline and keep your collection independent of any one store.

Standard EPUBs. Bring your own .epub files. Proselenos treats them like real books, not rentals.

Book Repo (optional). After you sign in with Google, you get a private Book Repo. You can upload books from your library to back them up, then restore them later if needed.

Built-in Bookstore. Browse free titles that authors have chosen to share. When you grab a book, it goes straight into your library, not a locked ecosystem.

Comfortable reading. Clean EPUB rendering, themes, reading progress, highlights and notes, and read-aloud with sentence highlighting.


3. FOR WRITERS SECTION

For writers

Authors Mode turns Proselenos into a focused writing and publishing studio.

Private workspace. Your manuscripts live in a secure space managed by Proselenos.

AI as assistant, not boss. Bring your OpenRouter API key and choose from models by Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, and others. Use them for line-edits, suggestions, and structural feedback inside a writing environment built for long-form work.

Hear your own prose. Text-to-speech reads your manuscript sentence by sentence. A simple way to catch rhythm issues, clunky lines, and missing words.

Publish on your terms. Turn a manuscript into an EPUB and optionally list it in the Proselenos Bookstore so readers can discover it.

One app, two modes. Read in E-Reader Mode, then open Authors Mode in a separate window when it's time to write, revise, or publish.


4. PHILOSOPHY SECTION

What Proselenos stands for:

Most ebook platforms behave like rental services pretending to be bookstores. They wrap books in DRM, tie them to one account, and can quietly remove or alter your library.

Proselenos goes the other way:

No DRM. Proselenos works with standard files you can back up, move, and keep. The app does not try to control how you use the books you already own.

Local-first. Your library lives on your device. If you want extra safety, use your Book Repo to back up books and restore them through the app.

Author-friendly. Writers get a private workspace, AI tools they control, and a simple path to publish. No black-box platform that owns everything.

Goodwill over lock-in. We assume readers and writers are here in good faith.

The aim is simple: a reading and writing environment where ownership, trust, and curiosity matter more than DRM and dashboards.
